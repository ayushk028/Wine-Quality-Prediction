# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Wine Quality Prediction is a **machine learning** project designed to classify the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used for this project is the **Wine Quality Dataset** from Kaggle, which consists of **12 features** and **6497 rows**.

## 📊 Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Fixed Acidity**
- **Volatile Acidity**
- **Citric Acid**
- **Residual Sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Density**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol**
- **Quality** (Target Variable)

## 🔄 Code Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, normalizing, and feature selection.
2. **Splitting the Data** - Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Training the Model** - Using different ML algorithms to train the model.
4. **Testing the Model** - Evaluating performance using accuracy metrics.
5. **Saving the Model** - Storing the trained model for future predictions.
6. **Loading the Model** - Retrieving the trained model for inference.
7. **Predicting Wine Quality** - Making predictions on new data.
8. **Displaying Results** - Showcasing the prediction accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data Manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** - ML Model Training
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data Visualization
- **Flask / Streamlit** (Optional) - Deployment

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 🔹 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

### 🔹 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔹 3. Run the Model
